		<p>COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV.
The virus is transmitted person-to-person by both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons through close contact (within 6 feet) via respiratory droplets.
 Transmission may also occur via aerosols and possibly through contact with fomites, although this is not thought to be a primary route.<br><br>
Clinically important features of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis include
infection of cells via binding of the viral spike protein to 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors
 with cell entry requiring type 2 transmembrane serine protease to cleave
 ACE2 receptor and activate viral spike protein.
infection of nasal and bronchial epithelial cells and pneumocytes early in infection.<br><br>
Firstly, we have to stop 
 seeing covid patient as a dangerous person. Because on some day we can also be like them.Mainly respect the doctors.
 Always turn a negative situation into a positive situation.</p>
