		<p>Orphanage is a residential institution, or group home, devoted to the care of orphans 
and other children who were separated from their biological families. Examples of what would cause a child to be placed in orphanages are when the parents were deceased,
 the biological family was abusive to the child, there was substance abuse or mental illness in the biological home that was detrimental to the child, 
 or the parents had to leave to work elsewhere and were unable or unwilling to take the child. <br><br>
 The role of legal responsibility for the support of children whose parents have died or are otherwise unable to provide care differs internationally. <br><br>
The use of government-run orphanages has been phased out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and in the 
European Union member-states during the latter half of the 20th century but continue to operate in many other regions internationally. </p>
