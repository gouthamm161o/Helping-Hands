		<font color="orange"><h3>"Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity, Actions speak louder than words."</h3></font>
		<p>Giving a helping hand to a needy one is not only a responsibility,but it’s also an act of humanity that we show towards others. 
We can make a difference in their lives even with a little – it doesn’t demand that much, 
just a little of what we have and a little of our time. 
We can change their lives and give them a good will & happiness, by showing them hospitalty and love.<br><br>
 We can care for what they need and we can give them this even with just a smile and a good deed. 
 Being poor doesn’t make them a different people or unwanted, it’s just a life course that they faced. 
 So I say that we should help everyone, no matter what colour, race or religion they have.<br><br>
It’s important not to be selfish. Yes, we must help the poor people. 
We must think that even we could be in the same situation as them one day.
 We can help them through organizations like FN,we could donate money so they can feed the poor people.
