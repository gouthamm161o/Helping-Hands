is part and parcel of the lives of the students.
 It is advantageous in many ways, and the prime one being it helps to keep an individual healthy.
We need to maintain proper hygiene and start cleaning our homes first.<br><br>
 After we are done with this, we need to reach out to the streets and important places like our schools. 
 Moreover, we should also tell other people to do the same as it is equally essential for them to stay clean.
Staying clean and healthy would not only keep you safe from any diseases but also will help you to keep your mind fresh.<br><br>
