		<p>The street children are those who move along the roads and have no definite place or house to live in.
 They move on streets, eat the leftover from the roadside dustbins and sleep on footpaths. <br><br>
 The street is their home. So they are called street children. Some of them earn their livelihood by working as a coolie. 
 Some live by serving as a helpmate in a house, some by doing some odd business. Among them, some also earn livelihood by sealing from the shops here 
 They have been left their parents either because the have illegal birth or because their father or mother has got married twice or thrice.
 Finding no other alternative, they take shelter on the streets. These children are deprived of many rights of a citizen.<br><br>
 They are even destitute of fundamental needs of life. They cannot go to schools. They cannot eat a square meal, let alone medical treatment. Thus, they remain underprivileged.</p>
