                The Helping Hands Foundation started as a CAS Project by IB Students from Ecole
                Mondiale World School. The Helping Hands Foundation is a voluntary organization 
                and is always in need of your help. While we have our trustees and sponsors, we
                still need volunteers to help us execute our plans.The Helping Hands Foundation
                has facilitated more than 100,000 masks, 15000 plus PPE kits and over 200,000 
                units of food items and are providing shelter to over 200 families at 3 shelter
                homes. There is more work in progress.As part of it, the Volunteers of HHH would
                be taking tuitions to help the children complete their homework and they also look
                after the basic needs of the children and do continuous follow ups regarding health
                and education of the child.

                Our mission is to provide accommodation to every single child who comes to Mumbai
                for cancer treatment thereby ensuring zero abandonment due to lack of accommodation.
                The Accommodation Project provides free accommodation to the child and the family 
                during the child's cancer treatment.
